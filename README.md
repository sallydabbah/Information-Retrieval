# Information-Retrieval
I built a crawler in python.
I choose the website https://www.imdb.com/ , the website is an online database,the search engine is very simple, the search queries is very simple also, you cannot search complicated queries that includes "OR" or "And" searches.
Our crawler allows to do multiple complicated searches such as "vin diesel and robert de niro movies"  it will return a value of a mutual movie that they played at together.
